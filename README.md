### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Khoirul Husein**, an active student of informatics engineering at Pancasila University who is passionate and creative. I have a strong passion for web development and love creating new things in the digital world. My seriousness in this field is proven by obtaining **national certification** as a junior web developer that is recognized by the National Professional Certification Agency (BNSP).

My solid skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** allow me to design attractive and interactive websites. I always try to learn and apply the latest web technologies so that I can create a great user experience.

Apart from that, I also have a great interest in understanding the principles of effective user interface design and creating responsive websites. I love to combine visual aesthetics with functionality to create engaging and satisfying user experiences.

I am passionate about advancing in the field of web development and am ready to take on the new challenges that arise. I believe that with commitment, hard work, and creativity, I can make a meaningful contribution to the technology industry.
